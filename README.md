The Customer Churn Prediction (CCP) Tool is a machine learning application designed to predict the likelihood of a customer churning from the bank. 

It utilizes data from the bank's customer database to train models that can accurately predict customer churn. 

The tool provides users with the ability to upload a CSV file containing customer data and then predicts the probability of churn for each customer in the uploaded dataset.

**Customer Churn Prediction:** The tool predicts the probability of a customer churning based on their demographic and transactional data.

**Model Evaluation:** The tool evaluates the performance of the predictive model using the Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC) metric.

**Customizable:** Users can upload their own datasets to generate churn predictions.

**Upload CSV File:** Click on the "Choose a file" button to upload a CSV file containing customer data. The tool supports both training and testing datasets.

**Run Churn Prediction:** After uploading the CSV file, click on the "Run Churn Prediction" button to initiate the churn prediction process. 

The tool will train a machine learning model using the provided data and display the predicted churn probabilities for each customer in the uploaded dataset.
